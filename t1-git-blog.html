  • What are the benefits of version control?
     Version Control allows you to keep track of changes in your work. This way, you can always go back to previous saved versions of document, file or project. If you make errors or are simply curious, you can "go back in time" to view a snapshot of your work or continue from a different point.

  • How does git help you keep track of changes?
 - Once you make changes to a file or piece of code, you can stage the changes to be saved using git add <FILENAME>. Then you can save or commit these changes using git commit <FILENAME> -m "Type your reference message here."

        • Why use GitHub to store your code?
 - Once you push your committed changes to a GitHub repository, they are saved on the internet remotely. Additionally, using GitHub your collaborators can see and edit your work without overwriting or potentially ruining it. Just like locally when you make branches using git, your collaborators can make branches from your work and eventually merge all these changes back to one master copy.
