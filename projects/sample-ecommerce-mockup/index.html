          The Exterior is as resistant to blending in as it is to wearing down. Designed exclusively for the Post, each landscape was painstakingly handcrafted in the good old US of A.

       <span id="description1" data-id="1">
          The Exterior is crafted from heavy, granite bedrock with 1 million years of heartland experience to back it up. While it may not always be autumn, these aspen groves and mesquite forests will always welcome you into this rugged simplicity. Americana at its best.

          The Blue Steel is crafted from hand-sliced 2mm metal plates, sourced from family mills in the heartland, then forged by our smiths to bring out the the subtle imperfections that breathe life and texture into these surfaces.  Signature blue ballistic ore boasts a rugged simplicity. Americana at its best.

         The Canyon is as resistant to blending in as  it is to wearing down. Designed exclusively for the Post, each gorge was painstakingly handcrafted in the good old US of A.
        </span>
        <span id="description3" data-id="3">
          The Canyon is crafted from a 100% time-tested limestone base, slow-carved over millions of years by the yearnings and annual outcries of the Rio Brio. Iron deposits in the water give the cliffs their classic burnt-red character. Americana at its best.
