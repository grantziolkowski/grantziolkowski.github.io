         <p><b>What is pair programming?</b></p>
         <p>
            Pair programming is a way for two or more people to collaborate
            writing code.  Usually one person will give instructions and navigate
            while the other person will type.
         </p>

         <p><b>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</b></p>
         <p>
            Pair programming allows you to learn from another person and share
            what you've learned.  It also helps you catch erros more quickly,
            which is good for debugging.  It's also good practice communicating.
         </p>

         <p><b>Driver vs Navigator</b></p>
         <p>
            The driver is physically typing out the code as per the navigator's
            instructions.  The navigator acts as the leader giving abstract
            instructions to the driver.
