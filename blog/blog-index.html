   <h2>Margin, Border, and Padding
 </h2>
<h3>
  Margin > Border > Padding
</h3>
<p>
Margin is the distance your text, block, or photo will be from an adjacent element, or the edge of the page. Use margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom to adjust the position.
<li>margin-top: 10px;</li>
</p>
<p>
Border creates a border around your element. It can be any width, any color, dashed or solid.
<li>border: 2px solid black;</li>
Padding is the distance between your element and the border
<li>padding: 20 px;</li>
</p>
<h2>Class vs. Id</h2>
<p>
CLASS. A class is category. You will assign many things to this category. Style the category once, don't style each individual element.
<li>Make it centered using class</li>
<li> .class_name {text-align:center}</li>

ID. An id is a nickname. You will assign one thing to this nickname. Name your id something logical so it stands out clearly on your CSS stylesheet.

<li>Make it red using id.</li>
<li> #id_name {color:red}</li>
</p>
<h2>position:absolute vs. relative vs. fixed</h2>
<p>
A relative block will take position attributes like margin, padding, left, right, top or bottom _in relation an another element with an absolute position.
</p>
<p>

A fixed block will stay glued to its position on the browser, even if you scroll up or down. Think of an old-school video game, where the background moves but the car you are driving stays put in the center of the screen, simulating movement.
</p>

<h2>display: inline vs. display: inline-block</h2>
<p>
Inline will place an item directly adjacent to another, "in line" with it.</p>
<p>
Inline block will also place it on the same line, but you can specificy the height, width, position, and additional margins to "block it off" from the adjacent element.
