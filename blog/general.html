  <h2 id="posttitle">Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h3 id="subtitle">Social identities and the subconcious</h3>
  <h4 id="date">February 18, 2015</h4>
  
    <p>Stereotype threat is a psychological process wherein someone of a specific social identity underperforms for fear of
  acting out a stereotype. This can be accentuated by a lack of trust towards a group at large, the perceived stereotypers. Additionally, stereotype threat
  has a compounding effect by which a person disengages from a group at large (i.e. a profession, field or school) or "disidentifies"
  with their own identity group for fear of acting out the stereotype.</p>
  
  <p>While I am lucky enough to not have been a direct victim of stereotype threat, I have suffered from the related "spotlight anxiety" or
    underperforming for fear of being judged. While not having to battle subconcious manifestations of racial or gender stereotypes, I can relate to this
    self-handicapping and sense of disappointment and resulting disilusionment. My experience has been in musical performance, and I have
    always asked myself, "What if I realy do lack the required talent?" or "What if I simply didn't prepare enough?" even though the poor
    examples of perforamance were almost always a case of mental self-sabotage.
  </p>
  
  <p>Like in education, the tech sector needs to foster a culture of trust to alleviate some of the instances of stereotype threat. 
  We need to stress a path of shared growth and learning rather than a competition and exhibition of ability/intelligence. I've already noticed
  this in paired programming exercises. Someone can always "show you want they know," whereas their nerves, or in many cases stereotype
  threat, can derail them when they are tested to perform.

    <h2 id="posttitle">Pair Programming and Giving/Receiving Feedback</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Pairing is Caring</h3>
    <h4 id="date">February 15, 2015</h4>
  
    <p>Pair programming has played a central role in the DevBootcamp experience thus far. For software developers,
    pair programming lets two or more team members catch bugs quickly by proofreading each other. It also provides an
    efficient teaching structure, where one person can "navigate" and guide the other person in real time. This technique has
    proved to be very valuable.</p>
    <p>When you pair with someone, it forces you to articulate yourself clearly and effectively review your technical
    knowlege in real time. It's one thing to feel your way through a challenge, arriving at the right answer by trial-and-error.
    It's another thing entirely to clearly spell out your steps to yourself or to someone else in a logical, clear manner.
    Pairing forces you to do that, and allows you to learn from someone else's techniques and explanations.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's frustrating when you're up against a road-block and you can't just "try anything." You need to
    patiently communicate your intentions and make sure you're on the same page with your partner before trying something
    blindly.</p>

    <p>Receiving feedback has been a positive experience thus far. It's helping me organize my thoughts and communicate
    them more effectively. I've been able to create a level of comfort and trust with pairs. From some of the feedback I've
    received, I need to speak up and share a little more, to assert my technical knowledge.</p>
    <p>Writing feedback is obviously more effective if you do it immediately after a session, so you don't lose track of
    who you were working with and how you worked together. It's a little bit touchy trying to give people actionable feedback, while remaining
    kind on a personal level. It is definitely empowering though, knowing you can help someone grow on a personal or technical level
    by giving them actionable, kind and specific annonymous feedback.

    <h2 id="posttitle">Issues in Tech</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Access, availability and scope</h3>
    <h4 id="date">February 7, 2015</h4>
  
    <p>
      It's common knowledge that the tech sector suffers from a lack of diversity. Women and minorities are severely underrepresented
      in the tech workplace. Companies that make an extra effort to hire from these groups will often pad their admin and business
      development staffs to make up for the lack of developer/programmer representation. Beyond this statistcal sleight-of-hand,
      when women and minorities are represented they are often victims of tacit descrimination or outright harassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the elephant issues of inequality and desrimination, the bro culture in tech perpetuates a lack of vision. This translates
      to limitations of scale and market-share. For example, most of the hottest startups, laregely lead by young, hetero white males, address
      the needs of their demographic. While one could argue everyone stands to gain from travelling, eating, dating, doing chores and being entertained
      efficiently and cheaply, the panoply of apps that address these issues suffer greatly from a marketting problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The universe of these consumer-centered "utopia" apps has come to synonify tech in the 21st century, but neither the producers
      nor the intended consumers are representative of contemporary America (or a global market for that matter). Beyond issues of equality
      and ethics, the tech sector stands to gain signficantly financially from designing products and marketting them to a pluralist society
      hungry for the hacks and and savings available to the elite. To put this in a hopeful if simplistic light, a diversity of perspective in
      the workplace leads to a diversity of products and public image, larger more diverse markets and more revenue. 
    </p>  
    <p>
     Of course, before everyone of all locations, races, ages, genders and sexual identities can take advantage of the collaborative, app-driven
     consumption of the 21st century, internet providers and government agencies need to promote cheap, fast, widespread internet
     as a public utility.

    <h2 id="posttitle">Thinking Style</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Mindsets and learning styles</h3>
    <h4 id="date">January 30, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      According to the Gregoric model, I am a "concrete random" thinker. This means I enjoy learning by trial-and-error, taking risks and experimenting. DevBootcamp allows me to dig in to the material individually, mess around with coding right away at the beginning of each week, before the material really has set in. Since I enjoy experimenting right away, my early solutions have not been very elegant and many times I have to redo hours of work simply because I began tinkering too early. Review has been both helpful and essential. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly, I subscribe to a growth mindset, where I am not afraid to take risks and make a sustained effort to learn new skills and concepts. In the back of my mind, however, I sense a fixed mindset firmly entrenched, mortified of failure. Even if I can grow my intelligence and skillset, I fear it will not be enough, that I will fall short. Ultimately, immersing myself in the vast knowledge pool of computer programming and web developing is the goal unto itself, not some abstract validation somewhere in the future.

<section id="fifth_from_top">
  <h2 id="posttitle">Week 1</h2>
  <h3 id="subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <h4 id="date">January 19, 2014</h4>
  <p>
      This is a challenge. I'm not talking about the material, or the workload or the the looming insecurities of getting a job, paying off the $12K, etc. I'm not talking about feeling little and hopelessly ineffectual as a novice jumping into this ocean of developers- as a single foot traveler on a 1000 mile journey.
   </p>
  <p>
   It's a personal challenge. DBC challenges you to challenge yourself, to dive in and dig deeper, past satisfactory competencies to a playful, creative flow, like musicians jamming or soccer players entering the zone of fast-paced intuitive collaboration. The Brazilians have their "beautiful game" and the Dutch have their "total football," where they relentlessly combine skill, speed, elegance and collaboration. This is exciting! The challenge is to not hold back, from your self, from your peers, from your instructors, from the community at large.
  </p>
    <p>
    It would be much easier to just do the homework and learn the required material. That's what I've always done. It's time to step it up and focus more on this journey and not any one intended end goal!
