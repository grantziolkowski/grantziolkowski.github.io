    <p>A friend once stepped on my mandolin, destroying the top. The main conflict that arose out of this situation
      centered on who was going to pay for the repairs. The conflict snowballed due to lack of communication. Asking for an
      apology and showing forgiveness were not the same as the large sum of money involved. I felt mostly powerless and 
      betrayed. 
    </p>
      <p>As the process got drawn out and the communication lines became less open, I had to have an honest conversation
    with my friend, removed from the emotional context, in order to resolve the issue and get past the elephant in the room.
    Although I'm glad cooler heads prevailed, I should have had this difficult conversation sooner. Stressful situations like
    conflicts only get worse as you let them fester so it's necessary to take an honest look at the situation, ask yourself
    if there is a direct action you can take to resolve it, and then make haste.
