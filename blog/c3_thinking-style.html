      According to the Gregoric model, I am a "concrete random" thinker. This means I enjoy learning by trial-and-error, taking risks and experimenting. DevBootcamp allows me to dig in to the material individually, mess around with coding right away at the beginning of each week, before the material really has set in. Since I enjoy experimenting right away, my early solutions have not been very elegant and many times I have to redo hours of work simply because I began tinkering too early. Review has been both helpful and essential.

      Outwardly, I subscribe to a growth mindset, where I am not afraid to take risks and make a sustained effort to learn new skills and concepts. In the back of my mind, however, I sense a fixed mindset firmly entrenched, mortified of failure. Even if I can grow my intelligence and skillset, I fear it will not be enough, that I will fall short. Ultimately, immersing myself in the vast knowledge pool of computer programming and web developing is the goal unto itself, not some abstract validation somewhere in the future.
