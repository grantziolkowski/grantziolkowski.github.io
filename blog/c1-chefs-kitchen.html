This is a challenge. I'm not talking about the material, or the workload or the the looming insecurities of getting a job, paying off the $12K, etc. I'm not talking about feeling little and hopelessly ineffectual as a novice jumping into this ocean of developers- as a single foot traveler on a 1000 mile journey.

It's a personal challenge. DBC challenges you to challenge yourself, to dive in and dig deeper, past satisfactory competencies to a playful, creative flow, like musicians jamming or soccer players entering the zone of fast-paced intuitive collaboration. The Brazilians have their "beautiful game" and the Dutch have their "total football," where they relentlessly combine skill, speed, elegance and collaboration. This is exciting! The challenge is to not hold back, from your self, from your peers, from your instructors, from the community at large.

It would be much easier to just do the homework and learn the required material. That's what I've always done. It's time to step it up and focus more on this journey and not any one intended end goal!
