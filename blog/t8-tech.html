    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) lets you retrieve and update data from a database.
    </p>
    
    <p>You need to be careful when using user input for your search values on a website.</p>
    
    <p>Either on purpose or by accident, a user could enter in valid SQL commands in a database field and
      you have potential for trouble.
    </p>
    
    <p>Sometimes users are bad and they can inject SQL commands that can alter your SQL statement, your database, and the 
      security of your website.
    </p>
    
    <p>For example, imagine a website with a field asking for your user name:</p>
    
    <p class="indent">User name: <br>
      <span id="search_field">" or ""="</span>
    </p>
    <p>Imagine your database read this and assigned " or ""=" to the value User.</p>
    <p>Adding " or ""=" as the username will cause dangerous confusion when querying the UserNames database using SQL.</p>
    <p>For example, a sample SQL query could read:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent">SELECT * FROM UserNames WHERE Name = '" + User + '"</p>
    <p>Reading from the data your user entered in the User field (" or ""="), your SQL query would result in:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent">SELECT * FROM UserNames WHERE Name = "" or ""=""</p>
    <p>Since <span class="courier">WHERE ""=""</span> is always true, THIS WOULD RETURN ALL OF THE User VALUES IN THE Usernames
    DATABASE.</p>
    <p>Now imagine the field was passwords, or credit card numbers... Careful now!</p>
