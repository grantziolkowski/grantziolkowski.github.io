      Arrays are very useful because you can run specific functions or methods that will act on or "iterate" over every element in the array. You only need to call these methods on your array name, rather than writing out all the information you've saved within it.
    </p>
    <p
      For example, you can add 1 to every number stored in your my_array variable by using the Array method "each".
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      my_array.each do |number|
      <br>
       &nbsp&nbsp number + 1
      <br>
      end
    </p>
    <p>I use "number" here to name the element, which identifies the individual list items your method will be acting on within the array </p>
    <p>The result of this Ruby code will be <span class="courier">[2,3,4,5,6]</span></p>
