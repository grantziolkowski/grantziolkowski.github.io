    <h2 id="posttitle">Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Social identities and the subconcious</h3>
    <h4 id="date">February 18, 2015</h4>
    
      <p>Stereotype threat is a psychological process wherein someone of a specific social identity underperforms for fear of
    acting out a stereotype. This can be accentuated by a lack of trust towards a group at large, the perceived stereotypers. Additionally, stereotype threat
    has a compounding effect by which a person disengages from a group at large (i.e. a profession, field or school) or "disidentifies"
    with their own identity group for fear of acting out the stereotype.</p>
    
    <p>While I am lucky enough to not have been a direct victim of stereotype threat, I have suffered from the related "spotlight anxiety" or
      underperforming for fear of being judged. While not having to battle subconcious manifestations of racial or gender stereotypes, I can relate to this
      self-handicapping and sense of disappointment and resulting disilusionment. My experience has been in musical performance, and I have
      always asked myself, "What if I realy do lack the required talent?" or "What if I simply didn't prepare enough?" even though the poor
      examples of perforamance were almost always a case of mental self-sabotage.
    </p>
    
    <p>Like in education, the tech sector needs to foster a culture of trust to alleviate some of the instances of stereotype threat. 
    We need to stress a path of shared growth and learning rather than a competition and exhibition of ability/intelligence. I've already noticed
    this in paired programming exercises. Someone can always "show you want they know," whereas their nerves, or in many cases stereotype
    threat, can derail them when they are tested to perform.

    <h2 id="posttitle">Ruby Classes</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Orient Your Objects</h3>
    <h4 id="date">February 14, 2015</h4>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>
      Classes are objects in Ruby that are essential to organizing your programs. They give you a way to assign variables and
      methods to each individual subset of a program. It's essential to compartmentalize your Ruby programs using classes to prevent
      creating confusing mess of variables and methods that apply to some parts of the program but not others.
    <p>
    <p>Create your class using All Caps like this:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      class WhatToDoToday
      <br>
      end
    </p>
    <p>Later on, we will create an instance of our class like this:<p>
    <p class="courier_indent">relax = WhatToDoToday.new</p>
    <p>Next we initialize by creating the initialize method in your class. Later on, every time we create an instance of
    the class, we'll need to initialize it using the same number of arguments as you set for your initialize method.
    For example, the top of your program will look like this:
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>class WhatToDoToday</p>
    <p><span class="courier_indent2";>def initialize(purpose, location, transportation=nil)<span> <br>
        <span class="courier_indent3";>  @purpose = purpose</span> <br>
        <span class="courier_indent3";>  @transportation = transportation</span> <br>
        <span class="courier_indent3";>  @location = location </span> <br>
        <span class="courier_indent2";>end</span></p>
     <p><class="courier_indent";>end</p>
     <p>Later on when you create an instance of the class, it will look something like this:</p>
     <p class="courier_indent";>work_hard = WhatToDoToday.new("business","work","train")
     <p>Or like this, if you take advantange of the defaualt value of <span class="courier">transportation</span>
       being <span class="courier">nil</span> or "nothing":
    <p class="courier_indent";> relax = WhatToDoToday.new("nothing","home")</p>
    <p>Within the initialize method, we create instance variables which you can reference from anywhere in the
      class. We create them by using the <span class="courier">@</span> sign, so now we have three instance variables, which
      take their values from whatever you give them when you you create an instance of the class and initialize it.</p>
   <p>So in our instance <span class="courier">relax</span>, the instance variable <span class="courier">@purpose = "nothing"</span>.</p>  
    <p>After the initialize method in your class, you'll want to give it some logic. In this case, we'll define an 
      instance method which you will be able to call on any instance of the class. Let's continue with our class 
      <span class="courier">WhatToDoToday</span> by defining an instance method <span class="courier">get_up_and_go</span>:</p>
   <p class="courier_indent";>class WhatToDoToday</p>
      <p class="courier_indent2";>def initialize(purpose, location, transportation=nil) <br>
        <span class="courier_indent">...</span> <br>
      end
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="courier_indent2";>def get_up_and_go</span> <br>
        <span class="courier_indent3">if @purpose == "nothing"</span> <br>
          <span class="courier_indent4">p "Slow down and rest at #{@location}!"</span> <br>
       <span class="courier_indent3">elsif @purpose == "business"</span> <br>
          <span class="courier_indent4">p "Get up early go to #{@location}!"</span> <br>
       <span class="courier_indent3">elsif @purpose == "pleasure"</span> <br>
          <span class="courier_indent4">p "Have fun at the #{@location}."</span> <br>
       <span class="courier_indent3">end</span> <br>
      <span class="courier_indent2">end</span> <br>
      <span class="courier_indent">end</span>
     </p>
  <p>So we can create our instance of the class <span class="courier">WhatToDoToday</span> and tell it what to do
  by calling the method <span class="courier">get_up_and_go</span>. The <span class="courier">=></span> sign just
  shows you what the computer will return:</p>
  <p><span class="courier_indent";>work_hard = WhatToDoToday.new("business","work","train")</span><br>
     <span class="courier_indent";>work_hard.get_up_and_go</span><br>
     <span class="courier_indent";>=> "Get up early go to work!"</span></p>
  <p>The other main topic when talking about Ruby Classes is attributes. Creating attribute readers <span class="courier">
  (attr_reader)<span> allows you to access the attributes of your class, namely the instance variables, 
  from outside of the class. Attribute writers <span class="courier">(attr_writer)</span>can be set
    from outside of the class, and attribute accessors <span class="courier">(attr_accessor)</span>can be read and set. 
    You create these at the beginning of your class, before the initalize method:
  </p>
   <p><span class="courier_indent";>class WhatToDoToday</span><br>
     <span class="courier_indent2";>attr_reader :transportation</span><br>
      <span class="courier_indent2";>def initialize(purpose, location, transportation=nil) <br>
      <span class="courier_indent2";> ...</span>
<p>So then we can read a particular attribute of the class by calling it like an instance method. In fact, creating
  <span class="courier">attr_reader :transportation</span> is just shorthand for:</p>
<p><span class="courier_indent2";>def transportation</span> <br>
    <span class="courier_indent3">@transportation</span> <br>
    <span class="courier_indent2";>end</span> <br></p>
<p>Let's try it:</p>
<p><span class="courier_indent";>rock_show = WhatToDoToday.new("pleasure","club", "taxi")</span><br>
    <span class="courier_indent";>rock_show.transportation</span><br>
    <span class="courier_indent";>=> "taxi"</span></p>

   <h2 id="posttitle">Pair Programming and Giving/Receiving Feedback</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Pairing is Caring</h3>
    <h4 id="date">February 15, 2015</h4>
  
    <p>Pair programming has played a central role in the DevBootcamp experience thus far. For software developers,
    pair programming lets two or more team members catch bugs quickly by proofreading each other. It also provides an
    efficient teaching structure, where one person can "navigate" and guide the other person in real time. This technique has
    proved to be very valuable.</p>
    <p>When you pair with someone, it forces you to articulate yourself clearly and effectively review your technical
    knowlege in real time. It's one thing to feel your way through a challenge, arriving at the right answer by trial-and-error.
    It's another thing entirely to clearly spell out your steps to yourself or to someone else in a logical, clear manner.
    Pairing forces you to do that, and allows you to learn from someone else's techniques and explanations.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's frustrating when you're up against a road-block and you can't just "try anything." You need to
    patiently communicate your intentions and make sure you're on the same page with your partner before trying something
    blindly.</p>

<p>Receiving feedback has been a positive experience thus far. It's helping me organize my thoughts and communicate
them more effectively. I've been able to create a level of comfort and trust with pairs. From some of the feedback I've
received, I need to speak up and share a little more, to assert my technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Writing feedback is obviously more effective if you do it immediately after a session, so you don't lose track of
who you were working with and how you worked together. It's a little bit touchy trying to give people actionable feedback, while remaining
kind on a personal level. It is definitely empowering though, knowing you can help someone grow on a personal or technical level
by giving them actionable, kind and specific annonymous feedback.

    <h2 id="posttitle">Ruby Enumerables</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Iterating through a data structure</h3>
    <h4 id="date">February 6, 2015</h4>
    <p>Enumerables operate on data collections like hashes and arrays. They are all based on the #each method, iterating through each element of an array or hash.</p>
    <h3>Cycle</h3>
    <p>
      Here's the pseudocode for the Cycle Enumerable:
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      array.cycle(n) {|element| code block}
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like the "each" method, cycle will run your code block on every element of your array. In addition to functioning like #each,
      it will iterate through your array n amount of times, or forever in an infinite loop if you do not specify an n value.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let's create an array. <span class="courier">my array = ["apples","oranges","pears"]</span>
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      my_array.cycle(2) {|fruit| p fruit}
    </p>
    <p>This will return:</p>
     <p class="courier_indent";>
      apples <br>
      oranges <br>
      pears <br>
      apples <br>
      oranges <br>
      pears
    </p>
    <p>If you do not assign a code block to your cycle method, it will return an Enumerator, which basically catalogs the contents of your array or hash.</p>
    <p>Let's give this enumeator a name:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      my_enumerator = my_array.cycle
    </p>
    <p>Check this out:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
       my_enumerator <br>
       my_enumerator.next <br>
       my_enumerator.next <br>
       my_enumerator.next
    </p>
    <p>This will return:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
     #&ltEnumerator: ["apples", "oranges", "pears"]:cycle&gt <br>
      apples <br>
      oranges <br>
      pears
      </p>

    <h2 id="posttitle">Issues in Tech</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Access, availability and scope</h3>
    <h4 id="date">February 7, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      It's common knowledge that the tech sector suffers from a lack of diversity. Women and minorities are severely underrepresented
      in the tech workplace. Companies that make an extra effort to hire from these groups will often pad their admin and business
      development staffs to make up for the lack of developer/programmer representation. Beyond this statistcal sleight-of-hand,
      when women and minorities are represented they are often victims of tacit descrimination or outright harassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the elephant issues of inequality and desrimination, the bro culture in tech perpetuates a lack of vision. This translates
      to limitations of scale and market-share. For example, most of the hottest startups, laregely lead by young, hetero white males, address
      the needs of their demographic. While one could argue everyone stands to gain from travelling, eating, dating, doing chores and being entertained
      efficiently and cheaply, the panoply of apps that address these issues suffer greatly from a marketting problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The universe of these consumer-centered "utopia" apps has come to synonify tech in the 21st century, but neither the producers
      nor the intended consumers are representative of contemporary America (or a global market for that matter). Beyond issues of equality
      and ethics, the tech sector stands to gain signficantly financially from designing products and marketting them to a pluralist society
      hungry for the hacks and and savings available to the elite. To put this in a hopeful if simplistic light, a diversity of perspective in
      the workplace leads to a diversity of products and public image, larger more diverse markets and more revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, before everyone of all locations, races, ages, genders and sexual identities can take advantage of the collaborative, app-driven
     consumption of the 21st century, internet providers and government agencies need to promote cheap, fast, widespread internet
     as a public utility.

    <h2 id="posttitle">Ruby Arrays and Hashes</h2>
    <h3 id="subtitle">Storing information in lists</h3>
    <h4 id="date">January 30, 2015</h4>

    <h3 id="subtitle">Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      Arrays allow you to store lists of information in Ruby. You can name your array any one word and write it like this:
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      <br>
      another_array = ["tree","dog","cat"]
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays are very useful because you can run specific functions or methods that will act on or "iterate" over every element in the array. You only need to call these methods on your array name, rather than writing out all the information you've saved within it.
    </p>
    <p
      For example, you can add 1 to every number stored in your my_array variable by using the Array method "each".
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      my_array.each do |number|
      <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp number + 1
      <br>
      end
    </p>
    <p>I use "number" here to name the element, which identifies the individual list items your method will be acting on within the array </p>
    <p>The result of this Ruby code will be <span class="courier">[2,3,4,5,6]</span>.</p>

    <h3 id="subtitle">Hashes</h3>
    <p>
     A hash is similar to an array of arrays. Each element in a hash has a key and a corresponding value. The hash is the list of these key-value pairs.
    </p>
    <p>Hashes look like this:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent">
           my_hash = {"cat" => "feline", "dog" => "canine"}
    </p>
    <p>Or like this:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent">
           another_hash = {
           "New_York": 8000000,
           "Chicago": 3000000
           }
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, the <span class="courier">New York</span> key has corresponding value of <span class="courier">8000000</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
       Here's how I would add another key-value pair to <span class="courier">my_hash</span>:
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent">my_hash["fish"] = "piscine"</p>
    <p>I've assigned the value <span class="courier">"piscine" </span>to the key<span class="courier"> "fish"</span>.</p>
    <p>Now, <span class="courier">my_hash = {"cat" => "feline", "dog" => "canine", "fish" => "piscine"}</span></p>

      According to the Gregoric model, I am a "concrete random" thinker. This means I enjoy learning by trial-and-error, taking risks and experimenting. DevBootcamp allows me to dig in to the material individually, mess around with coding right away at the beginning of each week, before the material really has set in. Since I enjoy experimenting right away, my early solutions have not been very elegant and many times I have to redo hours of work simply because I began tinkering too early. Review has been both helpful and essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly, I subscribe to a growth mindset, where I am not afraid to take risks and make a sustained effort to learn new skills and concepts. In the back of my mind, however, I sense a fixed mindset firmly entrenched, mortified of failure. Even if I can grow my intelligence and skillset, I fear it will not be enough, that I will fall short. Ultimately, immersing myself in the vast knowledge pool of computer programming and web developing is the goal unto itself, not some abstract validation somewhere in the future.

    <h3 id="subtitle">Style</h3>
    <h4 id="date">January 25, 2015</h4>

   <h3>Margin > Border > Padding</h3>
   <p>
       Margin is the distance your text, block, or photo will be from an adjacent element, or the edge of the page. Use margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom to adjust the position.
  </p>
  <p class="courier_indent">margin-top: 10px;</p>
   <p>
      Border creates a border around your element. It can be any width, any color, dashed or solid.
  </p>
  <p class="courier_indent">border: 2px solid black;</p>
  <p>
     Padding is the distance between your element and the border.
  </p>
  <p class="courier_indent">padding: 20 px;</p>

  <h3>Class vs. Id</h3>
  <p>
    CLASS. A class is category. You will assign many things to this category. Style the category once, don't style each individual element.
 </p>
 <p>Make it centered using class</p>
  <p class="courier_indent">.class_name {text-align:center}</p>
  <p>
    ID. An id is a nickname. You will assign one thing to this nickname. Name your id something logical so it stands out clearly on your CSS stylesheet.
 </p>
 <p>Make it red using id.</p>
  <p class="courier_indent">#id_name {color:red}</p>
  <h3>Position: absolute vs. relative vs. fixed</h3>
  <p>
    A relative block will take position attributes like margin, padding, left, right, top or bottom _in relation an another element with an absolute position.
  </p>
  <p>
    A fixed block will stay glued to its position on the browser, even if you scroll up or down. Think of an old-school video game, where the background moves but the car you are driving stays put in the center of the screen, simulating movement.
  </p>
   <h3>Display: inline vs. display: inline-block</h3>
  <p>
    Inline will place an item directly adjacent to another, "in line" with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inline block will also place it on the same line, but you can specificy the height, width, position, and additional margins to "block it off" from the adjacent element.

    <h3 id="subtitle">Version Control and Git</h3>
    <h4 id="date">January 19, 2015 </h4>
  <p>
  • What are the benefits of version control?
  <br>
    - Version Control allows you to keep track of changes in your work. This way, you can always go back to previous saved versions of document, file or project. If you make errors or are simply curious, you can "go back in time" to view a snapshot of your work or continue from a different point.
    </p>
    <p>
  • How does git help you keep track of changes?
  <br>
 - Once you make changes to a file or piece of code, you can stage the changes to be saved using git add <FILENAME>. Then you can save or commit these changes using git commit <FILENAME> -m "Type your reference message here."
    </p>
    <p>
   • Why use GitHub to store your code?
   <br>
   - Once you push your committed changes to a GitHub repository, they are saved on the internet remotely. Additionally, using GitHub your collaborators can see and edit your work without overwriting or potentially ruining it. Just like locally when you make branches using git, your collaborators can make branches from your work and eventually merge all these changes back to one master copy.

   This is a challenge. I'm not talking about the material, or the workload or the the looming insecurities of getting a job, paying off the $12K, etc. I'm not talking about feeling little and hopelessly ineffectual as a novice jumping into this ocean of developers- as a single foot traveler on a 1000 mile journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's a personal challenge. DBC challenges you to challenge yourself, to dive in and dig deeper, past satisfactory competencies to a playful, creative flow, like musicians jamming or soccer players entering the zone of fast-paced intuitive collaboration. The Brazilians have their "beautiful game" and the Dutch have their "total football," where they relentlessly combine skill, speed, elegance and collaboration. This is exciting! The challenge is to not hold back, from your self, from your peers, from your instructors, from the community at large.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be much easier to just do the homework and learn the required material. That's what I've always done. It's time to step it up and focus more on this journey and not any one intended end goal!
