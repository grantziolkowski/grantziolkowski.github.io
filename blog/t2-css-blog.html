   <p> - What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin > Border > Padding
Margin is the distance your text, block, or photo will be from an adjacent element, or the edge of the page. Use margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom to adjust the position.
] margin-top: 10px;
</p>
<p>
Border creates a border around your element. It can be any width, any color, dashed or solid.
] border: 2px solid black;
Padding is the distance between your element and the border
] padding: 20 px;
</p>

- What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
CLASS. A class is category. You will assign many things to this category. Style the category once, don't style each individual element.
.class

ID. An id is a nickname. You will assign one thing to this nickname. Name your id something logical so it stands out clearly on your CSS stylesheet.

#id

_position_:absolute vs. relative vs. fixed

A relative block will take position attributes like margin, padding, left, right, top or bottom _in relation an another element with an absolute position_.

A fixed block will stay glued to its position on the browser, even if you scroll up or down. Think of an old-school video game, where the background moves but the car you are driving stays put in the center of the screen, simulating movement.
</p>
<p>
_display_: inline vs. display: inline-block

Inline will place an item directly adjacent to another, "in line" with it.
Inline block will also place it on the same line, but you can specificy the height, width, position, and additional margins to "block it off" from the adjacent element.
