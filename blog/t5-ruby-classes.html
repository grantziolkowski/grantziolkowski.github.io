      Classes are objects in Ruby that are essential to organizing your programs. They give you a way to assign variables and
      methods to each individual subset of a program. It's essential to compartmentalize your Ruby programs using classes to prevent
      creating confusing mess of variables and methods that apply to some parts of the program but not others.
    <p>
    <p>Create your class using All Caps like this:</p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      class WhatToDoToday
      <br>
      end
    </p>
    <p>Later on, we will create an instance of our class like this:<p>
    <p class="courier_indent">relax = WhatToDoToday.new</p>
    <p>Next we initialize by creating the initialize method in your class. Later on, every time we create an instance of
    the class, we'll need to initialize it using the same number of arguments as you set for your initialize method.
    For example, the top of your program will look like this:
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      class WhatToDoToday
      <br>
      <p class="courier_indent";>
      def initialize(purpose, transportation=nil, location)
      <p class="courier_indent";>
        @purpose = purpose
        <br>
        @transportation = transportation
        <br>
        @location = location
        </p>
    end
    </p>
    </p>
     attr_reader :transportation
    def get_up_and_go
   if @purpose == "nothing"
     p "Slow down and rest at #{@location}!" 
   elsif @purpose == "business"
    p "Get up early go to #{@location}!" 
   elsif @purpose == "pleasure"
    p "Have fun at the #{@location}."
   end   
  end
  def get_there
    return if @transportation == nil
    p "Get there safe in your #{@transportation}!"
   end
end

relax = WhatToDoToday.new("nothing","home")
relax.get_up_and_go
relax.get_there
work_hard = WhatToDoToday.new("business","train","work")
work_hard.get_up_and_go
work_hard.get_there
rock_show = WhatToDoToday.new("pleasure", "taxi","club")
rock_show.transportation
rock_show.get_up_and_go
rock_show.get_there
    
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes talk 
    </p>
    <p
      Classes talk
    </p>
    <p class="courier_indent";>
      my_array.each do |number|
      <br>
       &nbsp&nbsp number + 1
      <br>
      end
    </p>
    <p>I use "number" here to name the element, which identifies the individual list items your method will be acting on within the array </p>
    <p>The result of this Ruby code will be <span class="courier">[2,3,4,5,6]</span></p>
