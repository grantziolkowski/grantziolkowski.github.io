<p><i> Curiosity</i> as a value is important to me. When you emphasize the curious search for knowledge, growth, wisdom and adventure
as an end unto itself, you take pressure off yourself. Whether you're learning something new or striving towards some accomplishment,
a sense of unmitigated curiosity and wonder can be more important than the concrete task at hand. This applies to everything from
social situations, cultural exploration and intellectual stimulation.</p>

<p>A friend recently asked advice for musical growth. I told him not to get bogged down in the technicalities and the daunting immensity
of the task at hand. Stay curious, stick to the task at hand regardless of any concrete accomplishments, and growth will come on its own.

<p>Affirming your values is an important tool for combatting stereotype threat and performance anxiety. If you affirm the values of
curiosity, growth, creativity, and adventure with an emphasis on personal development and challenge, you can take away the psychological
threat of underperforming. Focusing on your worth as a creative learner can take the bite out of a fear of failure. Know your worth
and don't worry about others' perceptions.</p>
