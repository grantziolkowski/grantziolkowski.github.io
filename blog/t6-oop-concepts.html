<p> Inheritance, composition and modules are different ways to organize your code. </p>
<p> Inheritance: abstract class hierarchy </p>
>> one object "is-a" other object: specialized variants feed into a superclass
 >> automatic delegation of messages invokes the correct behavior
 >> subclasses are bound to classes above them: amplifies modications, deeply embedded dependencies
 >> cost = objects in hiearchy, benefit = message delegation for free
 only for "correctly-modeled hierarchy"
 >>>reasonable: big changes in behavior can be made in small changes of code (at the top of hierarchy)
 >>>usable: open (for extension)-closed (for modification)
 >>>examplary: other coders will copy the sturcture of your subclasses
 >> what will happen in the future if I'm wrong?
 >> if object to be inherited is already part of a hierarchy, IMPOSSIBLE
<p> Composition: one object "has-a" other object
  >>inner object plays the object roll, not be a kind-of the class
  >>small parts that interact via well-defined interfaces
  >> composed behavior is more than sum of its parts
  >> cost = must explicity delegate messages, benefit =  structural independence
   >>> far fewer built-in dependencies = high tolerance for change

Inheritance example:
one subclass is a specialization of another class
class Vegetables < Array
  def
  end
  end
