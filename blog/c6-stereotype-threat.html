  <p>Stereotype threat is a psychological process wherein someone of a specific social identity underperforms for fear of
  acting out a stereotype. This can be accentuated by a lack of trust towards a group at large, the perceived stereotypers. Additionally, stereotype threat
  has a compounding effect by which a person disengages from a group at large (i.e. a profession, field or school) or "disidentifies"
  with their own identity group for fear of acting out the stereotype.</p>
  
  <p>While I am lucky enough to not have been a direct victim of stereotype threat, I have suffered from the related "spotlight anxiety" or
    underperforming for fear of being judged. While not having to battle subconcious manifestations of racial or gender stereotypes, I can relate to this
    self-handicapping and sense of disappointment and resulting disilusionment. My experience has been in musical performance, and I have
    always asked myself, "What if I realy do lack the required talent?" or "What if I simply didn't prepare enough?" even though the poor
    examples of perforamance were almost always a case of mental self-sabotage.

  <p>Like in education, the tech sector needs to foster a culture of trust to alleviate some of the instances of stereotype threat. 
  We need to stress a path of shared growth and learning rather than a competition and exhibition of ability/intelligence. I've already noticed
  this in paired programming exercises. Someone can always "show you want they know," whereas their nerves, or in many cases stereotype
  threat, can derail them when they are tested to perform.
