      It's common knowledge that the tech sector suffers from a lack of diversity. Women and minorities are severely underrepresented
      in the tech workplace. Companies that make an extra effort to hire from these groups will often pad their admin and business
      development staffs to make up for the lack of developer/programmer representation. Beyond this statistcal sleight-of-hand,
      when women and minorities are represented they are often victims of tacit descrimination or outright harassment.

      Beyond the elephant issues of inequality and desrimination, the bro culture in tech perpetuates a lack of vision. This translates
      to limitations of scale and market-share. For example, most of the hottest startups, laregely lead by young, hetero white males, address
      the needs of their demographic. While one could argue everyone stands to gain from travelling, eating, dating, doing chores and being entertained
      efficiently and cheaply, the panoply of apps that address these issues suffer greatly from a marketting problem.

      To put this in a hopeful if simplistic light, a diversity of perspective in any workplace leads to a diversity of products and public image.
      With proper investment and guidance, this leads to a larger, more diverse market and ultimately more revenue. 
      The universe of these consumer-driven "utopia" apps has come to synonify tech in the 21st century.
