      It's common knowledge that the tech sector suffers from a lack of diversity. Women and minorities are severely underrepresented
      in the tech workplace. Companies that make an extra effort to hire from these groups will often pad their admin and business
      development staffs to make up for the lack of developer/programmer representation. Beyond this statistcal sleight-of-hand,
      when women and minorities are represented they are often victims of tacit descrimination or outright harassment.

      Beyond the elephant issues of inequality and desrimination, the bro culture in tech perpetuates a lack of vision. This translates
      to limitations of scale and market-share. For example, most of the hottest startups, laregely lead by young, hetero white males, address
      the needs of their demographic. While one could argue everyone stands to gain from travelling, eating, dating, doing chores and being entertained
      efficiently and cheaply, the panoply of apps that address these issues suffer greatly from a marketting problem.

      The universe of these consumer-centered "utopia" apps has come to synonify tech in the 21st century, but neither the producers
      nor the intended consumers are representative of contemporary America (or a global market for that matter). Beyond issues of equality
      and ethics, the tech sector stands to gain signficantly financially from designing products and marketting them to a pluralist society
      hungry for the hacks and and savings available to the elite. To put this in a hopeful if simplistic light, a diversity of perspective in
      the workplace leads to a diversity of products and public image, larger more diverse markets and more revenue.

     Of course, before everyone of all locations, races, ages, genders and sexual identities can take advantage of the collaborative, app-driven
     consumption of the 21st century, internet providers and government agencies need to promote cheap, fast, widespread internet
     as a public utility.
