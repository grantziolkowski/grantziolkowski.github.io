    <p>Pair programming has played a central role in the DevBootcamp experience thus far. For software developers,
    pair programming lets two or more team members catch bugs quickly by proofreading each other. It also provides an
    efficient teaching structure, where one person can "navigate" and guide the other person in real time. This technique has
    proved to be very valuable.</p>
    <p>When you pair with someone, it forces you to articulate yourself clearly and effectively review your technical
    knowlege in real time. It's one thing to feel your way through a challenge, arriving at the right answer by trial-and-error.
    It's another thing entirely to clearly spell out your steps to yourself or to someone else in a logical, clear manner.
    Pairing forces you to do that, and allows you to learn from someone else's techniques and explanations.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's frustrating when you're up against a road-block and you can't just "try anything." You need to
    patiently communicate your intentions and make sure you're on the same page with your partner before trying something
    blindly.</p>

<p>Receiving feedback has been a positive experience thus far. It's helping me organize my thoughts and communicate
them more effectively. I've been able to create a level of comfort and trust with pairs. From some of the feedback I've
received, I need to speak up and share a little more, to assert my technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Writing feedback is obviously more effective if you do it immediately after a session, so you don't lose track of
who you were working with and how you worked together. It's a little bit touchy trying to give people actionable feedback, while remaining
kind on a personal level. It is definitely empowering though, knowing you can help someone grow on a personal or technical level
by giving them actionable, kind and specific annonymous feedback.
