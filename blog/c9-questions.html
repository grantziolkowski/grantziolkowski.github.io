 <p>
  Being able to ask a meaningful, specific question is essential to getting a meaningful, specific answer. Everyone
  on forums (whether you know them personally or not) is strapped for time. People are often skimming and/or scrollling through
  a page very quickly.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><i><b>Does your question have a title?</b></i></p>
  <p>
    If you hadn't been really reading the post, you definitely skimmed down and saw the bolded text. Your question needs to have
    a short and specific title that illustrates exactly what you need from an answer.
  </p>
  <p>A bad question:</p>
  <p class="indent"><i><b>JavaScript Problm: error trying string reverse</b></i></p>
  <p>A better question:</p>
 <p class ="indent"><i><b>How can I reverse the letters of a string in Javascript?</b></i></p>
 <p class="courier_indent">
    console.log("money".reverse())<br>
    /file.js:6 <br>
     "money".reverse() <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^ <br>
      TypeError: Object money has no method 'reverse'
 </p>
 <p>A couple things to keep in mind as to why this is a better question:</p>
 <p>
 <ul>
   <li>It's a question. Phrasing your question as a question, though not always possible, points the answer towards
     being an actual answer.  </li>
   <li>It's specific. Ask exactly what you need in order to solve your problem. Someone is more likely to click on
    your question and solve it if they know exactly what it will entail.
   </li>
   <li>No typos or grammatical issues. Proofread!</li>
   <li>No use of potentially confusing code syntax in the title. Save these for the code snippet</li>
   <li>Includes a very concise code snippet. If the problem is complex enough, people are going to want a snippet
     they can copy/paste into their own editor to try and run on their own. Don't include the whole program, just the
     part that needs help.
    <li>Points to a specific error message at specific line. Don't say you "get an error"; state the exact error and indicate where it occurs.</li>
   </li>
  
 </ul>
