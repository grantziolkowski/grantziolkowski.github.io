  Being able to ask a meaningful, specific question is essential to getting a meaningful, specific answer. Everyone
  on forums (whether you know them personally or not) is strapped for time. People are often skimming and/or scrollling through
  a page very quickly.
  </p>
  <p><i><b>Does your question have a title?</b></i></p>
  <p>
    If you hadn't been really reading the post, you definitely skimmed down and saw the bolded text. Your question needs to have
    a short and specific title that illustrates exactly what you need from an answer.
  </p>
  <p>A bad question:</p>
  <p><i><b>JavaScript Problm: error trying string reverse</b></i></p>
  <p>A better question:</p>
 <p><i><b>How can I reverse the letters of a string in Javascript?</b></i></p>
 <p class="courier_indent">
    console.log("money".reverse())<br>
    /file.js:6 <br>
     "money".reverse() <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ^ <br>
      TypeError: Object money has no method 'reverse'
 </p>
 <p>A couple things to keep in mind as to why this is a better question:</p>
 <p>
 <ul>
   <li>It's a question. Phrasing your question as question, though not always possible, point the answer towards
     being an actual answer.  </li>
   <li>It's specific. Ask exactly what you need in order to solve your problem.</li>
   <li>No typos or grammatical issues. Proofread!</li>
   <li>No use of potentially confusing code syntax in the title. Save these for the code snippet</li>
   <li>Includes a very concise code snippet. If the problem is complex enough, people are going to want a snippet
     they can copy/paste into their own editor to try and run on their own. Don't include the whole program, just the
     part that needs help.
    <li>Points to a specific error message at specific line. Don't say you "get an error"; state the exact error and indicate where it occurs.</li>
   </li>
  
 </ul>
